# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This project implements a simple **Rock Paper Scissors** game in JavaScript, where a user plays against the computer for 5 rounds. The results are logged in the console, and the winner is determined based on the scores at the end of the game.

## Features

1. **Random Computer Choice**  
   The computer makes a random selection from "rock," "paper," or "scissors."

2. **Human Input**  
   The user enters their choice through a `prompt`.

3. **Round Evaluation**  
   - If both choices are the same, it's a tie.  
   - If the human's choice beats the computer's choice, the human wins the round.  
   - Otherwise, the computer wins the round.

4. **Score Tracking**  
   The program keeps track of the scores for both the player and the computer across 5 rounds.

5. **Final Results**  
   - Displays whether the player wins, loses, or if the game is tied after 5 rounds.
